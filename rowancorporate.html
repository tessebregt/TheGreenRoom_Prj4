            <h2>Content</h2>
            <h4><span class="highlight-bold">Vision:</span></h4>
            <p>To build an inspiring environment where ideas grow, relationships deepen, and stories find their voices. A place where creativity has no limits and every moment sparks new possibilities.</p>

          <h4><span class="highlight-bold">Values:</span></h4>
            <h5>Everybody Deserves to Belong:</h5>
            <p>We believe that every person, regardless of background, experience, or identity, deserves a place to call their own, a space where they feel seen, valued, and understood. Whether you're a lifelong theater lover or just discovering the magic of the stage, here, you belong. This is a place where creativity knows no boundaries, where voices from all walks of life can find harmony, and where every individual is welcomed with open arms. We’re making the arts accessible for everyone.</p>

            <h5>Lasting Moments:</h5>
            <p>We believe that some experiences are meant to be felt, not just seen. It's not just about watching a performance or enjoying a drink, it's about creating moments that linger, stories that stay with you long after the curtain falls. Whether it's a spontaneous improvisation show, a heartwarming open mic night, or an immersive theater experience, we aim to create connections that last.</p>

            <h5>Fueling Stories, Igniting Voices:</h5>
            <p>We believe in the power of stories to transform and connect. From a whispered line in a script to the roar of applause at the end of a performance, every voice has the potential to spark something incredible. We're here to fuel that spark, whether it's over a quiet cup of coffee, a casual script reading, or a night of live entertainment.</p>

            <h5>Creativity Knows No Boundaries:</h5>
            <p>We believe creativity is not confined by walls or rules, it’s a force that knows no boundaries. It flows freely, uninhibited, and we’re here to support that freedom at every turn. Whether you’re an actor stepping into character, a writer breathing life into a new script, or someone enjoying the magic of live performance, we’ve created a space where creativity is celebrated, encouraged, and unleashed.</p>

			    <h4><strong>Brand Name:</strong></h4>
    <p>We came up with the brand name <em>The Green Room</em>, which refers to the backstage lounge where actors wait before performing.</p>

    <h4><strong>Visual Identity:</strong></h4>
    <p>General style:</p>
    <p>Logo:<br>
    The Green Room's logo features an elegant, vintage-inspired symbol with a coffee cup at the center, symbolizing the café atmosphere during the day. Below it, theatrical masks are highlighting the theater theme and live entertainment aspect of the brand. This gives the logo a classic, refined look and reflects the artistic and creative energy of the space. The design aligns with our mission of creating a warm, inspiring space where communities can gather.</p>

    <p>Color Palette:<br>
    We spent a long time searching for the perfect balance, colors that capture the warmth and creativity of the café during the day, as well as the intimate and theatrical ambiance of the bar at night.<br>
    Together, these (..show..) colors create a welcoming environment for theater lovers to gather. The mix of deep greens and reds reflect the traditional aesthetic of historic theatres, while the browns and creams provide a welcoming touch.<br>
    As the primary color we chose red.</p>

    <p>Typography:<br>
    We chose Berkshire Swash for our brand because it has a stylish, vintage look, like the lettering on classic theater signs and playbills. It has just the right mix of fancy details and easy-to-read letters, making it both elegant and inviting.</p>

    <p>Iconography:<br>
    In our branding, we’ll include small theater-inspired details like spotlights, vintage tickets, and decorative script accents. The graphics will be stylish but not too complicated, blending artistic with a clean look.</p>

    <p>Photography Style:<br>
    Our photography captures the energy of the theater world. We focus on candid, in-the-moment shots that showcase real interactions. Low contrast and warm tones will capture the nostalgic, inviting feel of the space. A mix of cozy café shots during the day and moody, atmospheric event photos at night will visually express the transformation of the space.</p>

    <h4><strong>Website and App Design:</strong></h4>
    <p>Layouts and Composition:<br>
    The website and digital materials have a clear, structured layout while adding playful, theatrical details like playbills and ornate frames. This design keeps things organized while still feeling creative and immersive. The text is styled for easy reading, with elegant headers and simple, modern body text for clarity. The layout is simple but engaging, making it easy to explore while keeping things interactive. At the top, our slogan invites visitors: “Step inside, take a seat, and let the story unfold.” The menu adds to the theme. Fun features like an event schedule, social media updates, and easy booking make the site more interactive. It also works smoothly on both computers and phones, so users can browse from anywhere. Flyers, posters, and menus match the vintage theater theme, using decorative designs, classic serif fonts, and rich, deep colors to strengthen the brand’s identity.</p>

    <p>Tone of Voice:<br>
    Our language is warm, informal and inviting, we want visitors to feel like they’re talking to a fellow theater lover.<br>
    We want to use playful theatrical references to keep messaging fun and immersive (e.g., “Take center stage with our signature cocktails” or “Join us for an encore-worthy performance”). Storytelling is key. Whether describing an event or our menu, we use narrative elements to create an emotional connection with our audience. Accessibility and inclusivity are central, our messaging ensures that both seasoned theatergoers and newcomers feel equally welcome.</p>

  <p>We chose Berkshire Swash for our brand because it has a stylish, vintage look, like the lettering on classic theater signs and playbills. It has just the right mix of fancy details and easy-to-read letters, making it both elegant and inviting. The font Recoleta was chosen for its refined and sophisticated appearance. Its bold, elegant serifs make it ideal for creating a strong yet approachable presence in the design. This font embodies the classic feel of vintage typefaces, aligning perfectly with the theatrical and artistic ambiance we aim to evoke, adding a modern twist to a timeless aesthetic.</p>

    <h4><strong>Target Audience:</strong></h4>
  <p>Our target audience spans a diverse age range, from students (16-25) to passionate theatre professionals and enthusiasts (25-50+). They are found primarily in urban and cultural hubs such as Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague, and Utrecht, as well as medium-sized cities like Groningen, Eindhoven, and Maastricht, where theatre culture thrives. They come from a mix of income backgrounds, with students seeking affordability and professionals willing to invest in premium experiences. Theatre lovers are typically engaged with the arts, whether through their academic pursuits, creative careers, or lifelong passion for theatre, storytelling, music, and literature.</p>

  <h4><strong>Demographics:</strong></h4>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Age:</strong> Ranges from students (16-25) to theatre professionals and enthusiasts (25-50+).</li>
    <li><strong>Location:</strong> Primarily urban and cultural hubs with strong arts scenes.</li>
    <li><strong>Income:</strong> Varies: students seeking affordability, professionals willing to invest in premium experiences.</li>
    <li><strong>Education:</strong> Theatre students, creatives, and lifelong arts enthusiasts.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4><strong>Psychographics:</strong></h4>
  <p>Theatre lovers value creativity, inclusivity, emotional connection, and self-expression. They enjoy frequent attendance at live performances, participate in theatre workshops, and stay engaged with theatre communities. However, they face challenges such as limited access to performances, high ticket costs, and lack of diverse representation in theatre.

  <h4><strong>Competitor and Market Landscape:</strong></h4>
  <p>The Dutch theatre industry consists of two primary sectors: subsidized and non-subsidized (commercial) theatre.
