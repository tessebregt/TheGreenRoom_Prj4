            <h4><span class="highlight-bold">Vision:</span></h4>
            <p>To build an inspiring environment where ideas grow, relationships deepen, and stories find their voices. A place where creativity has no limits and every moment sparks new possibilities.</p>

          <h4><span class="highlight-bold">Values:</span></h4>
            <h5>Everybody Deserves to Belong:</h5>
            <p>We believe that every person, regardless of background, experience, or identity, deserves a place to call their own, a space where they feel seen, valued, and understood. Whether you're a lifelong theater lover or just discovering the magic of the stage, here, you belong. This is a place where creativity knows no boundaries, where voices from all walks of life can find harmony, and where every individual is welcomed with open arms. We’re making the arts accessible for everyone.</p>

            <h5>Lasting Moments:</h5>
            <p>We believe that some experiences are meant to be felt, not just seen. It's not just about watching a performance or enjoying a drink, it's about creating moments that linger, stories that stay with you long after the curtain falls. Whether it's a spontaneous improvisation show, a heartwarming open mic night, or an immersive theater experience, we aim to create connections that last.</p>

            <h5>Fueling Stories, Igniting Voices:</h5>
            <p>We believe in the power of stories to transform and connect. From a whispered line in a script to the roar of applause at the end of a performance, every voice has the potential to spark something incredible. We're here to fuel that spark, whether it's over a quiet cup of coffee, a casual script reading, or a night of live entertainment.</p>

            <h5>Creativity Knows No Boundaries:</h5>
            <p>We believe creativity is not confined by walls or rules, it’s a force that knows no boundaries. It flows freely, uninhibited, and we’re here to support that freedom at every turn. Whether you’re an actor stepping into character, a writer breathing life into a new script, or someone enjoying the magic of live performance, we’ve created a space where creativity is celebrated, encouraged, and unleashed.</p>

			    <h4><strong>Brand Name:</strong></h4>
    <p>We came up with the brand name <em>The Green Room</em>, which refers to the backstage lounge where actors wait before performing.</p>

    <h4><strong>Visual Identity:</strong></h4>
    <p>General style:</p>
    <p>Logo:<br>
    The Green Room's logo features an elegant, vintage-inspired symbol with a coffee cup at the center, symbolizing the café atmosphere during the day. Below it, theatrical masks are highlighting the theater theme and live entertainment aspect of the brand. This gives the logo a classic, refined look and reflects the artistic and creative energy of the space. The design aligns with our mission of creating a warm, inspiring space where communities can gather.</p>

    <p>Color Palette:<br>
    We spent a long time searching for the perfect balance, colors that capture the warmth and creativity of the café during the day, as well as the intimate and theatrical ambiance of the bar at night. Together, these colors create a welcoming environment for theater lovers to gather. The mix of deep greens and reds reflect the traditional aesthetic of historic theatres, while the browns and creams provide a welcoming touch.<br>
    As the primary color we chose red.</p>

    <p>Typography:<br>
    We chose Berkshire Swash for our brand because it has a stylish, vintage look, like the lettering on classic theater signs and playbills. It has just the right mix of fancy details and easy-to-read letters, making it both elegant and inviting.</p>

    <p>Iconography:<br>
    In our branding, we’ll include small theater-inspired details like spotlights, vintage tickets, and decorative script accents. The graphics will be stylish but not too complicated, blending artistic with a clean look.</p>

    <p>Photography Style:<br>
    Our photography captures the energy of the theater world. We focus on candid, in-the-moment shots that showcase real interactions. Low contrast and warm tones will capture the nostalgic, inviting feel of the space. A mix of cozy café shots during the day and moody, atmospheric event photos at night will visually express the transformation of the space.</p>

    <h4><strong>Website and App Design:</strong></h4>
    <p>Layouts and Composition:<br>
    The website and digital materials have a clear, structured layout while adding playful, theatrical details. This design keeps things organized while still feeling creative and immersive. The text is styled for easy reading, with elegant headers and simple, modern body text for clarity. The layout is simple but engaging, making it easy to explore while keeping things interactive. At the top, our slogan invites visitors: “Step inside, take a seat, and let the story unfold.” The menu adds to the theme. Fun features like an event schedule, social media updates, and easy booking make the site more interactive. It also works smoothly on both computers and phones, so users can browse from anywhere. Flyers, posters, and menus match the vintage theater theme, using decorative designs, classic serif fonts, and rich, deep colors to strengthen the brand’s identity.</p>

    <p>Tone of Voice:<br>
    Our language is warm, informal and inviting, we want visitors to feel like they’re talking to a fellow theater lover.<br>
    We want to use playful theatrical references to keep messaging fun and immersive (e.g., “Take center stage with our signature cocktails” or “Join us for an encore-worthy performance”). Storytelling is key. Whether describing an event or our menu, we use narrative elements to create an emotional connection with our audience. Accessibility and inclusivity are central, our messaging ensures that both seasoned theatergoers and newcomers feel equally welcome.</p>
			  
 <p>Copywriting:<br>
   This tone of voice was crafted to reflect the heart of the space: creative, welcoming, and deeply connected to the world of theater. By using warm and informal language, we lower barriers and create a sense of familiarity, making the brand feel more like a passionate friend than a formal institution. Playful theatrical references aren’t just for flair they immerse the audience in a shared language that sparks joy and strengthens identity. Storytelling is used to build emotional resonance, transforming simple messages into memorable moments. And because the space is built on values of inclusivity and openness, the language ensures everyone whether a lifelong theater fan or a first-time visitor feels seen, invited, and valued.</p>
			  
 <p>Supporting Visuals:<br>
   The brand’s visual identity is carefully crafted to create a cohesive and emotionally resonant experience that reflects its values and connects with its audience. The color palette, featuring deep burgundy, soft beige, and warm neutrals, brings to mind the elegance of classic theater settings and creates a welcoming, comfortable atmosphere. Typography plays a central role in expressing the brand’s character. Headings use Berkshire Swash, a decorative serif font that adds theatrical flair and personality, while body text is set in Recoleta, a rounded and friendly serif that offers clarity and warmth. These fonts complement each other to create a visual rhythm that is expressive yet easy to read. Across the website, imagery and design elements are consistently chosen to support this tone, using lighting, textures, and compositions that evoke emotion and storytelling. Every visual decision is made with the target audience in mind, ensuring that the overall mood remains inviting, artistic, and true to the brand’s identity.</p>
			  
<p>Logo Design Process:<br>
   The process of creating the logo for The Green Room was centered around capturing the venue’s essence and connecting with its audience. We used a coffee cup above the text to symbolize the café atmosphere and a theater mask below to represent the venue’s creative, performance-driven identity. The typography, Berkshire Swash, was chosen for its vintage, elegant flair, evoking classic theater signage and cozy coffee shops. The color palette, featuring deep green, beige, and burgundy, was selected to create a sophisticated, warm feel that blends nature with vintage charm. The layout ensures a balanced design, with the coffee cup and theater mask working together to create a dynamic yet cohesive logo. This final design embodies the brand’s values of creativity, community, and inclusivity, inviting visitors into a space where theater, creativity, and coffee harmonize.</p>

            <h2>Marketing</h2>
    
    <p>At The Green Room, we believe every story deserves a stage. We’re more than just a café or a bar; we are a creative hub built for theatre lovers, artists, and dreamers. Our campaign reflects this identity by embracing freedom of expression, inclusivity, and storytelling at its core. It’s about building a community, both online and in-person, where like-minded individuals can come together to share ideas, perform, and feel truly seen.</p>

<h5><strong>Target Audience:</strong></h5>
<p>Our target audience includes two main segments:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Students (16–25):</strong> Passionate about the arts, active on social media, and looking for affordable, accessible cultural experiences.</li>
  <li><strong>Theatre Professionals and Enthusiasts (25–50+):</strong> More established in their careers or interests, seeking premium experiences and deeper connections within the arts.</li>
</ul>
<p>They are primarily based in cultural hubs like Amsterdam, Rotterdam, and Utrecht, and are highly engaged with visual platforms like Instagram and TikTok. These audiences spend 4–8 hours a day on screens and are most active during the evening (6–10 PM) and late-night hours (10 PM–4 AM).</p>

<h5><strong>Platform Strategy:</strong></h5>
<p>To reach our audience effectively, we focus on the following platforms:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Instagram and TikTok:</strong> These platforms are key for engaging with younger audiences. They thrive on short-form visual storytelling, which allows us to share behind-the-scenes content, artist spotlights, interactive stories, and creative event highlights.</li>
  <li><strong>Facebook:</strong> Remains vital for our older audience, providing an opportunity for event promotion, community discussions, and deeper engagement with theatre professionals.</li>
  <li><strong>Email Newsletters:</strong> A way to stay connected with our loyal audience by offering personalized updates, discount codes, and exclusive content.</li>
  <li><strong>Website:</strong> Our central hub for ticket purchases, livestreams, interviews, and event information.</li>
</ul>

<h5><strong>Campaign Message and Tone:</strong></h5>
<p>Our campaign aims to create a personal, immersive, and artistically-driven experience. We understand our audience values experiences over products, and by focusing on live events and storytelling, we tap into their desire for meaningful connection. The tone and aesthetic of our messaging create the feeling of being backstage, genuine, and full of possibilities. Our branding maintains a consistent, friendly, and inclusive tone across all platforms, ensuring that whether someone encounters us on Instagram, reads about us in an email, or enters the café, the message is clear: The Green Room is a place for community, creativity, and connection.</p>

<h5><strong>Community and Engagement:</strong></h5>
<p>The Green Room is designed to foster a community atmosphere. Our audiences are not just looking to watch performances; they want to participate, express themselves, and be part of a creative community. This is why our campaign focuses heavily on engagement—whether it's through social media interaction, live workshops, or community events, we encourage our audience to connect, collaborate, and share their passion for the arts.</p>

<h5><strong>Key Insights:</strong></h5>
<p>By focusing on storytelling and creative expression, we aim to connect with both our younger and older audiences. The use of Instagram and TikTok for younger audiences, and Facebook for older segments, allows us to meet them where they already are. By offering personalized and immersive experiences through email and our website, we can deepen the connection with our community, making The Green Room a central hub for theatre lovers and creatives alike.</p>

 <h5><strong>Objectives:</strong></h5>
  <p>To build a strong and recognizable online presence, The Green Room aims to reach at least 200 unique users across Instagram, TikTok, and Facebook within the first month of launching our campaign. This will be achieved through visually engaging, high quality content that reflects our brand’s creative and inclusive identity. Content types will include behind-the-scenes moments, performance teasers, interactive stories, and audience highlights crafted to spark engagement and foster community. This reach goal forms the first step in growing an active, loyal audience that supports and shares our vision.</p>
<h5><strong>Justification:</strong></h5>
  <p>We will focus mainly on reaching customers with our website. We aim to have a minimum of 200 people visit our website in the first month of running business in other words, our goal is to have 200 visits by the end of April. Based on a survey conducted in 2023, restaurant/bar/café customers search for such options on Google rather than other social media platforms (Cherylclaypoole, 2025).</p>
  <p>We aim to engage at least 200 audience members on Instagram, TikTok, and Facebook by posting visually engaging, high-quality content. Our goal is to achieve 20–50 views per post, 50–100 new followers, 100+ likes, and 30+ saves by the end of the month. Given the demographics, we expect a younger audience on Instagram and TikTok, while Facebook will help us reach an older demographic (Wood, 2021; Macready, 2025).</p>

  <h5><strong>Affect:</strong></h5>
  <p>The Green Room aims to create a welcoming and inspiring space where theatre lovers feel connected, understood, and free to express their creativity. By fostering a sense of belonging, we strive to immerse our audience in a passionate community that celebrates storytelling and the magic of theatre.</p>

  <h5><strong>Response:</strong></h5>
  <p>We aim to engage our audience on social media while driving at least 200 website visits by April. Given that customers mainly search on Google, our strategy prioritizes high-quality content on Instagram, TikTok, and Facebook to reach 200 engaged users, with goals of 20–50 views per post, 50–100 new followers, 100+ likes, and 30+ saves. Instagram and TikTok target younger audiences, while Facebook connects with older demographics.</p>

<h4><strong>Reflections and Future Planning:</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Learning Points:</strong> Throughout The Green Room campaign, we learned what resonated with our target audience and what areas need refining. Engaging, story-driven posts and event promotions received the most interaction, confirming the value of community-centered content. However, we noticed that general informational posts received less engagement, suggesting that more visual or interactive elements are needed in those formats. A key takeaway is the importance of consistency and variety—alternating between promotion, community features, and behind-the-scenes content kept the feed fresh and engaging. For future campaigns, we’d improve our planning for peak engagement times and create more content that encourages direct audience participation (polls, QandAs, etc.).</p>
<p><strong>Future Planning:</strong> Looking back at the campaign, we’re proud of how we captured The Green Room’s identity as a welcoming, creative space. Going forward, we plan to create a recurring content series that features local artists, performers, and visitors to build a stronger sense of community and involvement. Another idea includes spotlighting “a week in the life” at The Green Room—giving followers a behind-the-scenes look at events, rehearsals, and staff moments. These ideas are based on insights from social media engagement data and supported by literature on audience connection and content strategy, which emphasize authenticity, consistency, and storytelling as key drivers for engagement.
</p>
<p><strong>Professionalism:</strong> All campaign materials are professionally designed and consistently branded across platforms. Visuals, tone of voice, and messaging reflect The Green Room’s values and atmosphere. The assets are neatly organized in shared folders, with each file clearly labeled for easy navigation. Documentation includes the content calendar, caption drafts, design templates, engagement reports, and platform-specific strategies. The quality of our materials demonstrates a strong grasp of branding principles and a commitment to creating polished, purposeful content.
