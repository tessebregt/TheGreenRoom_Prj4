    <p>Hi fellow theatre lover. <br> <br>
Welcome to the green room, our little backstage hideaway, where the drinks flow as smoothly as a well-rehearsed monologue and every visitor is part of the ensemble!
<br>
<br>
We are a passionate group of four theatre enthusiasts, united by our deep love for all things theatre, whether it's a small improv group or a grand Broadway production. We believe every story and performer deserves a stage.
<br>
<br>
We created a space where theatre can be enjoyed over one of our limited edition cocktails/coffees. It's a place where new friendships can be made, but also a cosy place to catch up with old friends. 
<br>
<br>
We aim to create a cozy space where everybody feels like they are part of our little theatre family. It's a space that feels warm, a little dramatic, and always full of good stories.One thing is certain: it's a space where everybody is welcome.
