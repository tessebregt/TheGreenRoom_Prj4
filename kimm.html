    <p>Hi fellow theatre lover. <br> <br>
Welcome to the green room, our little backstage hideaway, where the drinks flow as smoothly as a well-rehearsed monologue and every visitor is part of the ensemble!
<br>
<br>
We are a passionate group of four theatre enthusiasts, united by our deep love for all things theatre, whether it's a small improv group or a grand Broadway production. We believe every story and performer deserves a stage.
<br>
<br>
We created a space where theatre can be enjoyed over one of our limited edition cocktails/coffees. It's a place where new friendships can be made, but also a cosy place to catch up with old friends. 
<br>
<br>
We aim to create a cozy space where everybody feels like they are part of our little theatre family. It's a space that feels warm, a little dramatic, and always full of good stories.One thing is certain: it's a space where everybody is welcome.

          <p class="box-text">At The Green Room, everyone deserves a place to belong, a space where they feel seen, valued, and understood.

Our inclusive community thrives on shared stories, laughter, and collaboration, ensuring no one is ever alone. In a divided world, The Green Room fosters connection, diversity, and meaningful storytelling. More than a café or theater, we are a community where everyone has a seat at the table.</p>

            <p class="box-text">At The Green Room, some experiences are meant to be felt, not just seen. It’s more than watching a performance or enjoying a drink, it’s about creating moments that linger long after the curtain falls. Whether it’s an improv show, an open mic night, or an immersive theater experience, we foster connections that last. Every interaction, from shared laughter to quiet inspiration, goes beyond the surface, inviting you to be present and engage. Through transformative experiences, we craft stories that spark conversations and remind us of the power of human connection—because the best moments are the ones that stay with you.</p>
